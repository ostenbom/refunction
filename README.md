Reusing containers for faster serverless function execution - Masters Project @ Imperial College

The latest fad in lightweight virtualisation primitives is known as serverless.  Rather than renting a portion of a server via a container or VM on a monthly basis, serverless platforms promise billing by the 1/10th of a second and infinite scaling exactly according to demand with almost no configuration. These features promise reduced developer operations, a lower barrier to entry for the cloud and reduced running costs.

Currently, serverless containers can experience high latencies on startup, known as “cold starts”.

This project aims to explore the possibility of reusing containers when running serverless functions, such that different users can use the same container, one after another, with a cleanup step in between. If successfull, this would eliminate cold starts all together.
